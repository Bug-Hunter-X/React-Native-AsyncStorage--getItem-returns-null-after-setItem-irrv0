This React Native bug occurs when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue arises when attempting to access data immediately after storing it.  Even though the `setItem` function appears to complete successfully, retrieving the data using `getItem` might return `null` or `undefined`. This is because AsyncStorage operates asynchronously, meaning the data isn't instantly available after the `setItem` call.
